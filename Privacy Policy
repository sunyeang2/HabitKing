Privacy Policy for HabitKing
Effective Date: 29/07/2025

HabitKing ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (“App”).

1. Information We Collect
HabitKing does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers or third parties.

All data you enter (such as habits, logs, and preferences) is stored locally on your device.

We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information.

2. How Your Data Is Used
Data entered in the App is used only for functionality within the App, such as tracking your habits, displaying progress, and customizing your experience.

Since your data stays on your device, we do not access, share, or sell any of it.

3. Third-Party Services
HabitKing does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking tools.

4. Data Security
Because your data is stored locally on your device, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. We recommend enabling device-level security (such as PIN, password, or biometric lock).

5. Children’s Privacy
HabitKing does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

6. Your Rights
You may delete all app data at any time by clearing the app storage or uninstalling the App.

Since we do not collect personal information, there is no stored data to request, export, or delete from our side.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted within the App or via the app store listing.
