  <p>HabitKing ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (“App”).</p>

  <h2>2. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>Data entered in the App is used only for functionality within the App, such as tracking your habits, displaying progress, and customizing your experience. Since your data stays on your device, we do not access, share, or sell any of it.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>HabitKing does <strong>not</strong> integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking tools.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Because your data is stored locally on your device, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. We recommend enabling device-level security (such as PIN, password, or biometric lock).</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>HabitKing does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may delete all app data at any time by clearing the app storage or uninstalling the App. Since we do not collect personal information, there is no stored data to request, export, or delete from our side.</p>
